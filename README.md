# Scoring

Scoring is a web application that helps score performances in real time.

## Idea

I had a class in school where each person had to score a different persons presentation. Instead of the profesor printing a paper and giving each one to the students, the professor asked somebody to create a solution on the PC. I had the idea to make a google sheets project, and share it with everybody. That was cumbersome and some students couldn't even download the app onto the phone. So why not create a website for just that. **Scoring presentations**.
